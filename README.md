# Employee-Login-Portal

This repository contains code I've created for an Employee login portal coded in **Java** and specifically using **NetBeans**.

The application itself allows users (employees) to log in to the companies portal and
  1. **View** their personal details.
  2. **Update** their existing password.
  3. **Update** any of their personal details.

The application also allows administator of the website to log in and perform new higher-privilege actions such as:
  1. **View any** employee's personal details
  2. **Update any** employee's existing password and personal details.
  3. **Add** a new employee to the database.
  4. **Delete** an existing employee from the database.
  

### Few things to note:

* Employees can log in and access content unique to them. 
* Contents differs for administrators. 
* This was developed using **NetBeans 8.2**.
* All the data was stored a **NetBean SQL** database.
* The website was hosted using NetBeans local server **"GlassFish"**
* 2 user Groups were created to represent the ones with user rights and those with admin rights.
