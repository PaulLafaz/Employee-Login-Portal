# Employee-Login-Portal

This repository contains code I've created for an Employee login portal coded in Java.

The application itself allows users (employees) to log in to the companies portal and
  1. View their personal details
  2. Change their existing password
  3. Change any of the personal details

The application also allows administator of the website to log in and perform new higher-privilege actions such as:
  1. View any employees personal details
  2. Change any employees existing password and personal details.
  3. Add a new employee to the database.
  4. Delete an employee from the database.
  

### Few things to note:

* Employees can log in and access content unique to them. 
* Contents differs for administrators. 
* This was developed using NetBeans 8.2.
* All the data was stored a NetBean SQL database.
* The website was hosted using NetBeans local server **"GlassFish"**
* 2 user Groups were created to represent the ones with user rights and those with admin rights.

#### Here are a few images of the Employee Portal:
